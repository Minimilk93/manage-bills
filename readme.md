Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

This is a project developed by a student at the University of Leeds for managing bills in shared households.

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

## Installation

The installation guide can be found in the [Laravel documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0).
This will allow you to run the Laravel development server to run the project.
Please note that PHP will be needed on your machine to run Laravel.

## Using the Web Application

The web application can be simply used by creating a profile from the navigation bar.
Once within the profile area, you can follow the instructions to create bills for an account.
